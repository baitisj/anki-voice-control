# anki-voice-control #
Module that uses [PocketSphynx](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/) to
allow simple voice commands when using Anki.

Control your review session using only your voice! This is great if you need
hands-free operation.

## Requirements ##

* gstreamer 
* pocketsphinx
... and python bindings for both.
In order to install the required software under Ubuntu:

`apt-get install python-pocketsphynx`<br>
`apt-get install gstreamer1.0-pocketsphinx`<br>
`apt-get install pocketsphinx-en-us`

## Future Work ##
Currently, this module only works under Linux. Contributions
that allow for use in other platforms are welcomed.

## Vocabulary ##
Here's a list of the voice commands that are currently implemented.

Command | Description
--------|-------------
answer | shows the answer side of the card
again<br>easy<br>good<br>hard | corresponding button on the answer side of the card
mark or star | Toggles the marked status of the card
undo | Same as the undo key
pause, resume | Say "pause," and the voice recognition will be disabled until you say "resume"
synchronize | synchronizes your collection.
bury card<br>bury note<br>suspend card<br>suspend note | management of cards
